# Implementation State

Last updated: 2026-04-26 00:52 SGT

## Loop Mode
- cadence: 10 one-shot cron wakes, 30 minutes apart
- mode: improve
- repo: /Users/chek/repos/desmos2usd-carey
- branch: fix/student-fixture-usdz-export
- pr: https://github.com/careylzh/desmos2usd/pull/1
- non-overlap: true; if an active Codex run is still going, later cron wakes must leave it alone and exit

## Executor Policy
- primary: home-codex-raw on chekstool
- optional-review: disabled unless Chek asks
- commit policy: commit after each wake completes a coherent task with passing validation; push to `chektien:fix/student-fixture-usdz-export`
- author: chektien <www@ch3k.com>

## Data Sources
- original URL CSV: /Users/chek/.openclaw/workspace/tmp/desmos2usd-ralph-control/desmos_urls_latest.csv, copied from /Users/chek/icloud/Downloads/desmos_urls_latest.csv; 66 rows parsed
- generated fixture artifacts: artifacts/fixture_usdz/
- viewer: http://chq.singapura-broadnose.ts.net:8765/viewer/

## Active Task
- index: 1
- id: push-recovered-list-expansion
- title: Push the validated recovered list-expansion tranche
- done-when:
  - the validated recovered list-expansion commit is pushed to `chektien:fix/student-fixture-usdz-export`
  - the main checkout no longer has an uncommitted copy of the same recovery tranche
  - then task 2 can start the all-CSV comparison report

## Ordered Task Cycle
1. [ ] Recover interrupted readable-CSV/list-expansion changes, regenerate all fixture artifacts, validate, commit/push if sound.
2. [ ] Build a CSV-to-fixture comparison report covering all 66 original Desmos URLs, with direct Desmos state/render evidence where available and clear unknowns where not.
3. [ ] Prioritize remaining partial fixtures by unsupported-count and visual-risk; fix one bounded mismatch category per wake.
4. [ ] Regenerate affected/full fixture artifacts, validate, commit/push, and comment on PR with concise evidence.
5. [ ] Repeat improvement pass until all 10 cron wakes are exhausted or no safe fixes remain.

## Known Current State
- PR #1 already has commits `baa8963` and `20b23c1` pushed.
- The readable-CSV/list-expansion recovery pass was validated with a full 71-fixture sweep:
  - `fixture_count=71`
  - `fixtures_with_usdz_count=71`
  - `error_count=0`
  - `success_count=19`
  - `partial_count=52`
- Recovered support covers Desmos ellipsis lists, scalar formulas over lists, `mod`, `\pi` implicit multiplication, and narrow single-letter implicit multiplication during list expansion.
- A local temp-clone commit was created for the recovery tranche, but it was not pushed because DNS resolution for `github.com` failed.
- Main checkout `.git` metadata is not writable in the HOME Codex sandbox, so the main checkout still shows these validated changes as uncommitted.
- Changed URL evidence from the CSV was recorded for eight affected student fixtures:
  - `https://www.desmos.com/3d/27v0xuv64m` (`S2-01 Group B`): classified `18 -> 116`, prims `15 -> 115`
  - `https://www.desmos.com/3d/1zpiejy9c9` (`S2-02 Group F`): classified `15 -> 111`, prims `4 -> 62`
  - `https://www.desmos.com/3d/sqkhp7wnx6` (`S2-03 Group E`): classified `178 -> 185`
  - `https://www.desmos.com/3d/5jh9zwy75e` (`S2-05 Group D`): status `partial -> success`, unsupported `8 -> 0`
  - `https://www.desmos.com/3d/cg2sd6h1ws` (`S2-06 Group E`): classified `24 -> 736`, prims `4 -> 407`
  - `https://www.desmos.com/3d/xrsgrdip5y` (`S2-08 Group C`): prims `9 -> 12`, unsupported `4 -> 1`
  - `https://www.desmos.com/3d/151jsdn8xs` (`S2-10 Group C`): prims `2 -> 3`, unsupported `6 -> 5`
  - `https://www.desmos.com/3d/tejhfrm34m` (`S2-10 Group F`): prims `83 -> 85`, unsupported `84 -> 82`

## Blockers
- Direct browser/Desmos rendering may be flaky; if live Desmos cannot be loaded, use frozen state plus local viewer/artifact structural evidence and say so.
- HOME Codex sandbox cannot write `.git/index.lock` in this checkout; use a temporary clone under `/tmp` for commit/push if this persists.
- `git push chektien HEAD:fix/student-fixture-usdz-export` failed from `/tmp/desmos2usd-commit.3Rcaap/repo` with `Could not resolve host: github.com`.

## Last Wake
- timestamp: 2026-04-26 00:52 SGT
- result: recovered dirty list-expansion tranche and created a local temp commit; push blocked by DNS/network
